    description: 'Whenever you want to build a product from scratch, the best option is to go with the easiest solution. A landing page with external CMS could well be enough. Maybe even a static page faking what you’re try to solve would work. Products should be built for their users. What product do you want to build? How can you create the best user experience? Think about who will be using your system. Will they work on desktops or tablets? Will they access things via a mobile connection (as 70% of all users currently do)? Thanks to my experience and knowledge in front-end development I&apos;m able to answer on all this questions.'
